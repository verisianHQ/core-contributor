              - Cited Guidance: If an FA record does have a parent record, the value in FAOBJ
                  should match the value in --TERM or --TRT, unless the parent
                  domain is dictionary coded or subject to controlled
                  terminology, in which case FAOBJ should match the value in
                  --DECOD.

              - Cited Guidance: A record in FA may or may not have a parent record in an events
                  or interventions domain. If an FA record does have a parent
                  record, the value in FAOBJ should match the value in --TERM or
                  --TRT, unless the parent domain is dictionary coded or subject
                  to controlled terminology. In such cases, the value
                  represented in FAOBJ will match the value represented in
                  --DECOD.
