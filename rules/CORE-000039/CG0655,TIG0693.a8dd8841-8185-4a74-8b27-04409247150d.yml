              - Cited Guidance: The values of VISITNUM in the TV dataset are the valid values of
                  VISITNUM for planned Visits.  Any values of VISITNUM that
                  appear in subject-level datasets that are not in the TV
                  dataset are assumed to correspond to unplanned Visits.  This
                  applies, in particular, to the subject-level Subject Visits
                  (SV) dataset; see SV under Section 5, Models for
                  Special-Purpose Domains, for additional information about
                  handling unplanned Visits.

              - Cited Guidance: Specification-SVPRESP  Used to indicate whether the visit was
                  planned (i.e., visits specified in the TV domain). Value is
                  "Y" for planned visits, null for unplanned visits. Planned and
                  unplanned visits with a subject, whether or not they are
                  physical visits to the site, are represented in this domain.
