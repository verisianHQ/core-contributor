Description: When study does not use multi-stage arm assignments and ACTARM is
  populated, ACTARM must be present in TA.ARM. This rule has been executed to
  identify all cases when ACTARM is not present in TA.ARM and therefore
  acknowledges that false positives may be recorded when multi-stage arm
  assignments are in use.
Executability: Partially Executable - Possible Overreporting

Outcome:
  Message: ACTARM value in DM dataset is not among the values of ARM variable in
    the TA dataset. This is allowed only in a multistage study with incomplete
    ARM assignment. Please confirm if your study is a multistage assignment
    study.
