              - Cited Guidance: For domains with two-letter domain codes (i.e., other than
                  SUPPxx and RELREC), split dataset names can be up to four
                  characters in length... The four-character dataset-name
                  limitation allows the use of a Supplemental Qualifier dataset
                  associated with the split dataset
