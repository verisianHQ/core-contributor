              - Cited Guidance: There are separate codelists used for PPORRESU/PPSTRESU where
                  the choice depends on whether the value of the pharmacokinetic
                  parameter is normalized. Codelist PKUNIT is used for
                  non-normalized parameters. Codelists PKUDMG and PKUDUG are
                  used when parameters are normalized by dose amount in
                  milligrams or micrograms respectively. Codelists PKUWG and
                  PKUWKG are used when parameters are normalized by weight in
                  grams or kilograms respectively. Multiple subset codelists
                  were created for the unique unit expressions of the same
                  concept across codelists, this approach allows study-context
                  appropriate use of unit values for PK analysis subtypes
