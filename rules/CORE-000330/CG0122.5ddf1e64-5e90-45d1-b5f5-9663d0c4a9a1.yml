                  included in the Demographics dataset, with ARMCD = "SCRNFAIL'
                  and ARM = "Screen Failure". Subjects withdrawn from a trial
                  before assignment to an Arm, if they are not screen failures,
                  should have ARMCD ='NOTASSGN' and ARM = 'Not Assigned'.
