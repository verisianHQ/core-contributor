              - Cited Guidance: The SDTM permits one value for each Qualifier variable per
                  record. If multiple values exist (e.g., due to a "Check all
                  that apply" instruction on a CRF), then the value for the
                  Qualifier variable should be "MULTIPLE" and SUPP-- should be
                  used to store the individual responses.
