                  subject passed through an Element that, although defined in
                  the TE dataset, was out of place for the Arm to which the
                  subject was assigned. For example, if a subject in a parallel
                  study of Drug A vs. Drug B was assigned to receive Drug A, but
                  received Drug B instead, then TAETORD would be left blank for
                  the SE record for their Drug B Element. If a subject was
                  assigned to receive the sequence of Elements A, B, C, D, and
                  instead received A, D, B, C, then the sponsor would have to
                  decide for which of these subject Element records TAETORD
                  should be populated. The rationale for this decision should be
                  documented in the Comments column of the define.xml.
