              - Cited Guidance: Domain datasets based on the SDTM general observations classes
                  will be named using the two-character code for the domain or
                  using the applicable four-character code when a dataset is
                  split. Supplemental Qualifier datasets will be named using
                  convention SUPP concatenated with the two-character domain
                  code or four-character code when a dataset is split (e.g.,
                  SUPPDM, SUPPFA, SUPPFACM). All other datasets will be named
                  using the code for the domain or dataset and (e.g., DM,
                  RELREC).
