              - Cited Guidance: Note that SESTDTC is required, although --STDTC is
                  not required in any other subject-level dataset. The purpose of
                  the dataset is to record the Elements a subject actually passed
                  through. We assume that if it is known that a subject passed through
                  a particular Element, then there must be some information on when
                  it started, even if that information is imprecise. Thus, SESTDTC
                  may not be null, although some records may not have all the components
                  (e.g., year, month, day, hour, minute) of the date/time value collected.
