              - Cited Guidance: "ICH E3: Section 10.1 indicates that 'the specific reason for
                  discontinuation' should be presented; and that summaries
                  should be 'grouped by treatment and by major reason.' The
                  CDISC SDS Team interprets this guidance as requiring one
                  standardized disposition term (DSDECOD) per disposition event.
                  If multiple reasons are reported; the sponsor should identify
                  a primary reason and use that to populate DSTERM and DSDECOD.
                  Additional reasons should be submitted in SUPPDS."
