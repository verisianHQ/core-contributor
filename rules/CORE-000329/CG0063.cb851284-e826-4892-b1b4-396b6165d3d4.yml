              - Cited Guidance: 'A sponsor may collect one disposition event for the trial as a
                  whole, or they may collect disposition for each Epoch of the
                  trial. When disposition is collected for each Epoch, the
                  variable EPOCH should be included in the DS dataset. When
                  EPOCH is populated for disposition events (records with DSCAT
                  = DISPOSITION EVENT), EPOCH is the name of the Epoch for the
                  disposition event described in the record. This is a subtly
                  different meaning from that of EPOCH when it is used in other
                  general-observation-class domains, where EPOCH, as a Timing
                  variable, is the name of the Epoch during which --STDTC or
                  --DTC falls. The values of EPOCH are drawn from the Trial Arms
                  domain, Section 7.2 - Experimental Design: Trial Arms (TA)'
