              - Cited Guidance: The --ORRES variable contains the result of the measurement or
                  finding as originally received or collected. --ORRES is an
                  expected variable and should always be populated, except (1)
                  when --STAT = "NOT DONE" (because there is no result for such
                  a record) or (2) for derived records.
