              - Cited Guidance: When findings are collected about an event or intervention, and
                  the name of the event or intervention is collected in an
                  "Other, specify" CRF field, the value in --OBJ variable
                  depends on whether the FA record has a parent record and
                  whether the "Other, specify" value was coded.
