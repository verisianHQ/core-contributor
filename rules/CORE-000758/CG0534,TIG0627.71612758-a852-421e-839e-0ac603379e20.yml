              - Cited Guidance: As described in Section 4.1.4, Order of the Variables, RFSTDTC
                  is used to calculate study day variables. RFSTDTC is usually
                  defined as the date/time when a subject was first exposed to
                  study drug. This definition applies for most interventional
                  studies, when the start of treatment is the natural and
                  preferred starting point for study day variables and thus the
                  logical value for RFSTDTC. In such studies, when data are
                  submitted for subjects who are ineligible for treatment (e.g.,
                  screen failures with ARMNRS = "SCREEN FAILURE"), subjects who
                  were enrolled but not assigned to an arm (e.g., ARMNRS = "NOT
                  ASSIGNED"), or subjects who were randomized but not treated
                  (e.g., ARMNRS = "NOT TREATED"), RFSTDTC will be null. For
                  studies with designs that include a substantial portion of
                  subjects who are not expected to be treated, a different
                  protocol milestone may be chosen as the starting point for
                  study day variables. Some examples include non-interventional
                  or observational studies, studies with a no-treatment arm, or
                  studies where there is a delay between randomization and
                  treatment.
