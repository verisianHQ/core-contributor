                  horizontal format, the length of --TEST is limited to 40
                  characters (except as noted below) to conform to the

                  exceptions to the above 40-character rule and are limited to
                  200 characters, since they are not expected to be transformed
                  to column labels.

              - Cited Guidance: Because of limitations of SAS v5 Transport files, the lengths of
                  data values cannot exceed 200 characters. Because --TEST
                  values may become column labels upon transformation, the SDTM
                  additionally restricts them to 40 characters.
