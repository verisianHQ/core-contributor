                  of a subject's status. The response to the status assessment
                  may trigger collection of additional details, but those
                  details are to be stored in appropriate separate domains. For
                  example, if a subject's survival status is "DEAD", the date of
                  death must be stored in DM and within a final disposition
                  record in DS. Only the status collection date, the status
                  question, and the status response are stored in SS.
