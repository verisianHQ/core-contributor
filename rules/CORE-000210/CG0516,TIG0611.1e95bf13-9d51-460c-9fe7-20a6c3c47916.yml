Description: When study does not use multi-stage arm assignments and ARMCD is
  populated, ARMCD must be present in TA.ARMCD. This rule has been executed to
  identify all cases when ARMCD is not present in TA.ARMCD and therefore
  acknowledges that false positives may be recorded when multi-stage arm
  assignments are in use.
