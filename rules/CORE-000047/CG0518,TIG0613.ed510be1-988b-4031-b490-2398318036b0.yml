Description: When study does not use multi-stage arm assignments and ARM is
  populated, ARM must be present in TA.ARM. This rule has been executed to
  identify all cases when ARM is not present in TA.ARM and therefore
  acknowledges that false positives may be recorded when multi-stage arm
  assignments are in use.
Executability: Partially Executable - Possible Overreporting
Operations:
  - domain: TA
    id: $ta_arm
    name: ARM
    operator: distinct
Outcome:
  Message: ARM value in DM dataset is not among the values of ARM variable in TA
    dataset. This is allowed only in a multistage study with incomplete ARM
    assignment. Please confirm if your study is a multistage assignment study
