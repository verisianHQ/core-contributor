              - Cited Guidance: An event with DSCAT = “DISPOSITION EVENT” describes either
                  disposition of study participation or of a study
                  treatment.  It describes whether a subject completed study
                  participation or a study treatment, and if not, the reason
                  they did not complete it. Dispositions may be described for
                  each Epoch (e.g., screening, initial treatment, washout,
                  cross-over treatment, follow-up) or for the study as a whole.
                  If disposition events for both study participation and study
                  treatment(s) are to be represented, then DSSCAT provides this
                  distinction. The value of DSSCAT is based on the sponsor's
                  controlled terminology, however for records with DSCAT =
                  "DISPOSITION EVENT", DSSCAT = "STUDY PARTICIPATION" is used to
                  represent disposition of study participation. DSSCAT = "STUDY
                  TREATMENT" can be used as a generic identifier when a study
                  has only a single treatment. If a study has multiple
                  treatments, then DSSCAT should name the individual treatment.
