                  "2006-11-02"Date and Time Reported in a Domain Based on
                  Findings. When the date/time of collection is reported in any
                  domain, the date/time should go into the --DTC field (e.g.,
                  EGDTC for Date/Time of ECG). For any domain based on the
                  Findings general observation class, such as lab tests which
                  are based on a specimen, the collection date is likely to be
                  tied to when the specimen or source of the finding was
                  captured, not necessarily when the data was recorded. In order
                  to ensure that the critical timing information is always
                  represented in the same variable, the --DTC variable is used
                  to represent the time of specimen collection. For example, in
                  the LB domain the LBDTC variable would be used for all
                  single-point blood collections or spot urine collections. For
                  timed lab collections (e.g., 24-hour urine collections) the
                  LBDTC variable would be used for the start date/time of the
                  collection and LBENDTC for the end date/time of the
                  collection. This approach will allow the single-point and
                  interval collections to use the same date/time variables
                  consistently across all datasets for the Findings general
                  observation class. The table below illustrates the proper use
                  of these variables. Note that --STDTC is not used for
                  collection dates over an interval, so is blank in the
