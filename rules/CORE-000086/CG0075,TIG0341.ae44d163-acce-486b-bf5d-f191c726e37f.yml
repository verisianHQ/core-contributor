              - Cited Guidance: 1. The DV domain is an Events model for collected protocol
                  deviations and not for derived protocol deviations that are
                  more likely to be part of analysis. Events typically include
                  what the event was, captured in --TERM (the topic variable),
                  and when it happened (captured in its start and/or end dates).
                  The intent of the domain model is to capture protocol
                  deviations that occurred during the course of the study (see
                  ICH E3, Section 10.2[1]).
