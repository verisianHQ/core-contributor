              - Cited Guidance: Split dataset names can be up to four characters in length. For
                  example; if splitting by --CAT; then dataset names would be
                  the domain name plus up to two additional characters (e.g.,
                  QS36 for SF-36). If splitting Findings About by parent domain;
