              - Cited Guidance: Groups of records can be related by using grouping variables
                  such as --LNKID or --LNKGRP in IDVAR.  Using --LNKID or
                  --LNKGRP can be a more efficient method of representing
                  relationships in RELREC when relating a single or group of
                  records in one dataset to a group of records in another
                  dataset.
