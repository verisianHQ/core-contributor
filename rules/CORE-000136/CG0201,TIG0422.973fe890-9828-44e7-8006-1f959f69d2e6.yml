              - Cited Guidance: This example shows how to use the RELREC dataset to represent
                  related information that is submitted as two datasets that
                  have a one-to-many relationship. in the example below  all the
                  records in one domain are being related to all of the records
                  in the other, so both  USUBJID and IDVARVAL are null.... Since
                  IDVAR identifies the keys that can be used to
                  merge/join  records between the datasets, --SEQ cannot be used
                  because --SEQ only has meaning within a subject within a
                  dataset, not across datasets.
